*** Summation Notation

Summation is the addition of numbers and is
specified by a rule defined in the notation using the upper case Greek
letter sigma $\sum$.

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n$

- i is the index of summation
- 1 is the starting point (lower limit ofsummation)
- n is the stopping point (upper limit of summation)
- i is the summation element

When we use the summation symbol, it is useful to remember the following rules:

\begin{align*}
\end{align*}

*** Double Sum

In certain situations, using a double sum may be necessary.


which can be visualised as the sum of items of matrix:

*** Double Index

To represent the data of a table or a matrix, double index notation is
commonly used. Where $x_{ij}$ corresponds to the $i$th row and the
$j$th column item.

** Arithmetic Sequence

** Geometric Sequence

This is an *exponential* changng sequence shown by:


* Proof by Induction


There are 4 steps of math induction:

- Show $P(1)$
- Assume $P(k)$
- Show $P(k) \rightarrow P(k+1)$
