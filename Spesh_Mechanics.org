* Dynamics

** Force

** Newton's Laws of Motion

A mass of m kg on the Earth's surface has a force of $m$ kg $wt = mg N$
acting on it. This force is known as *weight*

The *momentum* of a particle is defined as the product of its mass and
velocity: $momentum = mass \times velocity$


** Resolution of Forces and Inclined Planes

** Connected Particles

** Variable Forces

** Equilibrium

** Vector Functions
