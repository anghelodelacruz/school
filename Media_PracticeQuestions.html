<li>In 2010, the Attorney General’s Department conducted a review of

this study conclusions were made such as:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stronger evidence of short-term effects rather than long-term</li>
<li>Unexplored third variables</li>
<li>Opposing arguments that have not been rebutted</li>

that is direct on a passive audience. Semiotics however suggests
that media texts are constructed using a shared code which is

<p>
The study of media influence determines how, why and under what
circumstances such influence occurs. For the media to have some
influence over its audiences, it must communicate with them. This
means that there needs to be a relational process of creating and
interpreting messages that elicit a response. The persuasiveness and
power of the media in society are modelled in communication theories
which over time have become increasingly sophisticated as they seek to
explain the complexities in the relationships between the media and
its audience. These models and theories are derived from research. 
</p>

<p>
In the early twentieth century, concern about the influence of the
media centred on propaganda, the popular media and on broadcasting. In
the latter part of the twentieth century the concept of addiction to
TV, violent films and pornography became the focus of alarm about the
media. As markets emerged for various media forms, debate had begun on
the influence on its audience. Today, moral panic about the media had
shifted from violence to privacy and the health impact of media
consumption.
</p>

<p>
For much of the last century, research into media effects centred on
the concept of the passive or active audience. Its focus was on how
the text affected the audience rather than on how the audience may
interact with and interpret the text. Recent theories however are now
interested in uncovering these complexities.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga6ae670">
<p>
Hypodermic Needle Theory 1920s-1940s was one of the earliest theories of media
influence focussing on the tranmission on the audience. It is a linear
communication theory which suggests that the media has a direct and
powerful influence on audiences, like being injected with a hypodermic
needle. This means that audiences are directly affected by the media
they consume. In this theory, audiences are passive and homogenous not
acocunting for individual differences.
</p>

<p>
Semiotics 1970s, this is a method of text analysis that deals with the
relationship between a text and the culture that produces or consumes
it. Through signs and systems, semiotics examines the nature of
meaning within the contexts of media form, production, message and
consumption. It suggests that media texts are constructed using a
shared code which is encoded by the sender and read by the
receiver. In this theory, audiences are active because they construct
meaning from texts by 'reading' signs. Meaning varies as signs can
have both shared and individual connotations.
</p>

<p>
These two theories differ greatly and in between the half century that
they were developed, it can be seen how complex these theories have
become. Hypodermic needle theory is often supported by moral panics
such as the Orson Wellees War of the Worlds broadcast in 1938. Its
influence in comparison to semiotics is much greater as it assumes
audiences are passive. It falls short in the simplistic nature it
holds and is often disregarded as an outdated way of thinking about
media influence. This is because audiences have become more active
than this theory suggests. Semiotics however is on the opposite end of
the scale of media influence. As this suggests audiences construct
their own meaning, the theory cannot be supported by empirical
evidence and there is no way of constructing research. This is a
similarity in the sense that both are used as a way of thinking about
media influence rather than solid structure of communication between
media text and audience. However as one focuses on transmission the
other focuses on the role of the reader and how it links our reading
of texts with culture and values. As hypodermic needle theory is
simple and well defined, semiotics is loosely defined in its
approach. The evidence, or the lack there of in each theory is similar
as one suggests exaggerated evidence of moral panic caused by the
broadcast and the other unable as there is no agreed way of conducting
research for such a theory.
</p>

<p>
In continuity, these theories differ in the academic approaches that
the researchers have used. As hypodermic needle theory falls under the
category of the effects tradition, it focuses on the effect that media
texts have on audiences. Therefore its research lies within
experimental studies and quantitative evidence. This differs in
cultural studies in semiotics which focuses on the act of
communication and the issue of media influence within the context of
society and culture. It acknowledges that individual media consumption
and construction of meaning exists. Its research lies within surveys,
interviews and other qualitative evidence.
