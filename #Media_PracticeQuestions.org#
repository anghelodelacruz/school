** Q1
  
 - a) Identify one communication model or theory that is used to
   suggest that the media has little influence on audiences.
   - Reinforcement theory suggests that the media has little power to
     influence the audience because they only reinforce prexisting
     attitudes and beliefs.

 - b) Discuss the arguments and evidence used to support the
   communication model or theory that you identified in part a.

   -

** Q2

 - a) The media is subject to regulation that may define standards, set
   limitations or place ethical parameters on it. Explain a form of
   media regulation.
   - The National Classification Scheme. The Attorney General's
     Department is responsible for the classification of films, video
     games and publications in Australia. A Classification Board and
     Classification Review Board make decisions about the
     classifications of these media forms. These classification
     categories include: G, PG, M15+, MA15+, R and X.
 - b) Discuss two arguments in favour of this type of media regulation.
   1. +Copycat behaviour+
   2. Protecting children
      - The classifications ranging from G to R18+ are aimed to protect
	children from material likely to upset or disturb. These
	restrictions also take in effects so that in the morning or
	early afternoon these inappropriate rated content will be
	filtered away from these times.
   3. Protecting adults
      - Media texts that are likely to offend are structured into a
	classification system with consumer advice warning them of the
	content which may contain violence or strong language so that
	adults can decide the material they watch.
   4. +Protecting cultural identity+
   5. +Media Ownership+

** Q3

 - Discuss the influence that media forms and texts can have on an
   audience. In your response, include the following:
   - an example where the media is claimed to have had an influece on a
     specific audience.
   - relevant communication models and theories used to explain the
     influence.
   - substantiated arguments about the claims made in the example.
 - In 2010, the Attorney Generalâ€™s Department conducted a review of
   research into the effect of violent video games. Overall, most
   studies have consistently shown a small statistical effect of
   violent video game exposure on aggressive behaviour, but there are
   problems with these findings that reduce their policy relevance. In
   this study conclusions were made such as:
   - Stronger evidence of short-term effects rather than long-term
   - Unexplored third variables
   - Opposing arguments that have not been rebutted
   - Little evidence that violent video games have a greater impact
     than other violent media.
 - However in contrast to this review, there are a number of case studies
 demonstrating the effects of VVG. This includes:
   - Copycat Behaviour
     - Which are isolated incidents such as the Mortal Kombat killer of
       the boy who shot his grandmother. This suggests that influence
       takes place through the General Aggresssion Model through
       learning, rehearsal and reinforcement which cultivates
       aggressive beliefs and attitudes, perception, expectations,
       behaviour scripts and desensitises.


** Q4

 - Compare one communication model or theory from the effects tradition
   with a cultural studies theory.
   - Hypodermic Needle Theory
   - Semiotics
 - The Effects tradition focuses on the effect that media texts have on
   the audiences while cultural studies focuses on the individual media
   consumption and the construction of meaning through
   context. Hypodermic Needle Theory is a relatively powerful theory in
   comparison to Semiotics as it assumes a linear effect of influence
   that is direct on a passive audience. Semiotics however suggests
   that media texts are constructed using a shared code which is
   encoded by the sender and read by the receiver. Its audiences are
   active because they construc meaning from texts. Hypodermic needle
   theory is considered outdated as audiences are now more active.

** Nature

The study of media influence determines how, why and under what
circumstances such influence occurs. For the media to have some
influence over its audiences, it must communicate with them. This
means that there needs to be a relational process of creating and
interpreting messages that elicit a response. The persuasiveness and
power of the media in society are modelled in communication theories
which over time have become increasingly sophisticated as they seek to
explain the complexities in the relationships between the media and
its audience. These models and theories are derived from research. 

In the early twentieth century, concern about the influence of the
media centred on propaganda, the popular media and on broadcasting. In
the latter part of the twentieth century the concept of addiction to
TV, violent films and pornography became the focus of alarm about the
media. As markets emerged for various media forms, debate had begun on
the influence on its audience. Today, moral panic about the media had
shifted from violence to privacy and the health impact of media
consumption.

For much of the last century, research into media effects centred on
the concept of the passive or active audience. Its focus was on how
the text affected the audience rather than on how the audience may
interact with and interpret the text. Recent theories however are now
interested in uncovering these complexities.

** Communication Theories

Hypodermic Needle Theory 1920s-1940s was one of the earliest theories of media
influence focussing on the tranmission on the audience. It is a linear
communication theory which suggests that the media has a direct and
powerful influence on audiences, like being injected with a hypodermic
needle. This means that audiences are directly affected by the media
they consume. In this theory, audiences are passive and homogenous not
acocunting for individual differences.

Semiotics 1970s, this is a method of text analysis that deals with the
relationship between a text and the culture that produces or consumes
it. Through signs and systems, semiotics examines the nature of
meaning within the contexts of media form, production, message and
consumption. It suggests that media texts are constructed using a
shared code which is encoded by the sender and read by the
receiver. In this theory, audiences are active because they construct
meaning from texts by 'reading' signs. Meaning varies as signs can
have both shared and individual connotations.

These two theories differ greatly and in between the half century that
they were developed, it can be seen how complex these theories have
become. Hypodermic needle theory is often supported by moral panics
such as the Orson Wellees War of the Worlds broadcast in 1938. Its
influence in comparison to semiotics is much greater as it assumes
audiences are passive. It falls short in the simplistic nature it
holds and is often disregarded as an outdated way of thinking about
media influence. This is because audiences have become more active
than this theory suggests. Semiotics however is on the opposite end of
the scale of media influence. As this suggests audiences construct
their own meaning, the theory cannot be supported by empirical
evidence and there is no way of constructing research. This is a
similarity in the sense that both are used as a way of thinking about
media influence rather than solid structure of communication between
media text and audience. However as one focuses on transmission the
other focuses on the role of the reader and how it links our reading
of texts with culture and values. As hypodermic needle theory is
simple and well defined, semiotics is loosely defined in its
approach. The evidence, or the lack there of in each theory is similar
as one suggests exaggerated evidence of moral panic caused by the
broadcast and the other unable as there is no agreed way of conducting
research for such a theory.

In continuity, these theories differ in the academic approaches that
the researchers have used. As hypodermic needle theory falls under the
category of the effects tradition, it focuses on the effect that media
texts have on audiences. Therefore its research lies within
experimental studies and quantitative evidence. This differs in
cultural studies in semiotics which focuses on the act of
communication and the issue of media influence within the context of
society and culture. It acknowledges that individual media consumption
and construction of meaning exists. Its research lies within surveys,
interviews and other qualitative evidence.
