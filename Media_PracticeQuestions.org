** Q1
  
 - a) Identify one communication model or theory that is used to
   suggest that the media has little influence on audiences.
   - Reinforcement theory suggests that the media has little power to
     influence the audience because they only reinforce prexisting
     attitudes and beliefs.

 - b) Discuss the arguments and evidence used to support the
   communication model or theory that you identified in part a.

   -

** Q2

 - a) The media is subject to regulation that may define standards, set
   limitations or place ethical parameters on it. Explain a form of
   media regulation.
   - The National Classification Scheme. The Attorney General's
     Department is responsible for the classification of films, video
     games and publications in Australia. A Classification Board and
     Classification Review Board make decisions about the
     classifications of these media forms. These classification
     categories include: G, PG, M15+, MA15+, R and X.
 - b) Discuss two arguments in favour of this type of media regulation.
   1. +Copycat behaviour+
   2. Protecting children
      - The classifications ranging from G to R18+ are aimed to protect
	children from material likely to upset or disturb. These
	restrictions also take in effects so that in the morning or
	early afternoon these inappropriate rated content will be
	filtered away from these times.
   3. Protecting adults
      - Media texts that are likely to offend are structured into a
	classification system with consumer advice warning them of the
	content which may contain violence or strong language so that
	adults can decide the material they watch.
   4. +Protecting cultural identity+
   5. +Media Ownership+

** Q3

 - Discuss the influence that media forms and texts can have on an
   audience. In your response, include the following:
   - an example where the media is claimed to have had an influece on a
     specific audience.
   - relevant communication models and theories used to explain the
     influence.
   - substantiated arguments about the claims made in the example.
 - In 2010, the Attorney Generalâ€™s Department conducted a review of
   research into the effect of violent video games. Overall, most
   studies have consistently shown a small statistical effect of
   violent video game exposure on aggressive behaviour, but there are
   problems with these findings that reduce their policy relevance. In
   this study conclusions were made such as:
   - Stronger evidence of short-term effects rather than long-term
   - Unexplored third variables
   - Opposing arguments that have not been rebutted
   - Little evidence that violent video games have a greater impact
     than other violent media.
 - However in contrast to this review, there are a number of case studies
 demonstrating the effects of VVG. This includes:
   - Copycat Behaviour
     - Which are isolated incidents such as the Mortal Kombat killer of
       the boy who shot his grandmother. This suggests that influence
       takes place through the General Aggresssion Model through
       learning, rehearsal and reinforcement which cultivates
       aggressive beliefs and attitudes, perception, expectations,
       behaviour scripts and desensitises.


** Q4

 - Compare one communication model or theory from the effects tradition
   with a cultural studies theory.
   - Hypodermic Needle Theory
   - Semiotics
 - The Effects tradition focuses on the effect that media texts have on
   the audiences while cultural studies focuses on the individual media
   consumption and the construction of meaning through
   context. Hypodermic Needle Theory is a relatively powerful theory in
   comparison to Semiotics as it assumes a linear effect of influence
   that is direct on a passive audience. Semiotics however suggests
   that media texts are constructed using a shared code which is
   encoded by the sender and read by the receiver. Its audiences are
   active because they construc meaning from texts. Hypodermic needle
   theory is considered outdated as audiences are now more active.
