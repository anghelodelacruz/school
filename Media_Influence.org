** How can something that's so much fun be so controversial?

The greatest problem with discussing media influence lies iin defining the discussion. 
What do we mean by the term 'influence' and are there different types of influence? Which media are we talking about?



** Issues in discussing media influence 

*** Influence is about communication, communication is about relationships

For the media to have some influence over its audiences, it must
communicate with them. Communication is a relational
process. According to Professor Celeste Condit of the University of
Georgia: /Communication is not about transferring, disseminating or
ciruclating information, but is about the relationships between
participants in the communication process/. Relationships determine
how they interpret the content.

Media theory has two apparently contradictory sides:
- The mdia is assumed to influence individuals and the community,
  often in negative ways
- The right for media producers to make and market their products is
  bound up in the belief of freedom of expression.


** A breif history of moral panics about media effects

The controversy surrrounding the influence of the media is much
older. Prior to the invention of the printing press, knowledge in the
Western world was controlled by the church and people communicated
orally. Manuscripts were handtranscribed in Latin by monks. To read
these, one entered the church eduation system. Few people were able to
read. 

The printed world changed the way information and later entertainment was distributed and consumed. 

/One should be cautious in adopting a new kind of poetry or music, for
this endangers the whole system... lawlessness creeps in there unawares./

/There is no such thing as innate ideas; there is no such thing as
moral precept; we are born with an empty mind, with a tablet - tabula
rasa - ready to be writ upon by experimental impressions./

This philosophy had a powerful impact on the way Western societies
though children should be educated and the influences they should be
exposed to in the world, lest children be corrupted by their
experiences.

During Victorian times, popular weekly magazines called Penny
Dreadfuls were avidly consumed by the newly literate working class. It
wsa even claimed that these publications would lead to copycat crimes,
and that 'there is not a boy or a young lad tried at our Cousts of
Justice whose position there is not more or less due to the effect of
unwholesome literature upon his mind'

In the early twentieth century, concern about the influence of the
media centred on propagranda, the popular media and on
broadcasting. Within decades, moving pctures and then talkies became
both new media wonders and the focus of worry about their effects on
audiences.

Research conducted by the Payne Fund concluded that high levels of
movie attendance were associated with declining morals, delinquent
behaviour and lower intelligence. This led in a way to the Haynes
Code, which stressed the moral importance of entertainment, and
detailed content that was morally acceptable and unacceptable in the
motion pictures. 

In the latter part of the twentieth century the concept of addication
to TV, violent films and pornography became the focus of alarm about
the media. The proliferation of emerging media markets alllowed the
debate about the influence of the media on its audiences to become a
regular feature in the media itself.

With todays media, moral panic about the media has shifted from
violence to privacy, and the health impact of media consumption.

** Media theories are influenced the time and place of their production




*** Theories and models

- The polictial economy model holds that the media are simply part of
  an economics system where power and control reside in political and
  economic institutions.
- The effects model holds that media forms and content have strong
  effects on indiviudlas and society. This model sees the media as
  powerful agents of change.
- The cultural model holds that it is culture - which includes the political economy and the media.

*** A brief history of resarch into media effects

4 stages 

- 1930 :: Opinion about media effects was dominated by concern about
          the influence of propaganda.
- 1930s - 1960s :: media researches worked under the belief that the
                   media had limited effects and power over
                   attitudinal change resided in the individual.
- Late 1960s :: Resurgence of the idea that the media had strong
                effects on its audiences.
- 1980s :: Researchers have used a social constrctivist model which
           examines the relationship between the media and its
           audiences.

*** Early theories of media influence were about transmission


**** Transmission models of Communication

At first, media communication was thought of as a linear
process. Communication was considered hierarchical (transmitted from
the top down). This was the 'natural' order of things at the time and
commiunciation theory reflected this order.

This model was dominant for the first half of the twentieth century
and influenced even later.


*** Bullet or hypodermic communication models

=Silver bullet theory=

A model where audiences are directly affected by the media messages they consume.

Medium $\rightarrow$ Message $\rightarrow$ Audience

*** The Laswell model 

=Who says what in which channel to whom with what effect?=

*** Shannon Weaver model

Deals with the transmission of information, rather than communication as we 

*** Wilbur Schramm

*** The limited effects paradigm


* Media Influence 

** Introduction

*Outline*
- Vulnerability
- Audiences

What is it, what forms does it come in, to what extent does it exist
today. Issues in discussing media influence.

Media does not influence every person the same way.

Vulnerable audiences are a key aspect of media influence. Vulnerable
audiences are based entirely by context.

[[c:Users/Anghelo/Google Drive/12 Media/img/two_step_flow.jpg][two-step-flow-model]]

[[./img/two_step_flow.jpg][two step]]

A diffusion moel of influence, suggesting that people are more liekly
to be influenced by 'opinion leaders' - people who are more connected
to the media than their peers and pass on media messages.

This theory was an important development in the study of media
influence because it established a link between mass media
communication and interpersonal communication. The media put ideas out
there, but people carry the message.


** Multistep flow model

This model, similar to the two-step flow model, acknowledges that
media between audience members who have no direct contact with the
media or opinion leaders.

Audiences are more prone to be influeced by those who are similar to
them than who are different.

Today we must consider the limited effects model in tandem with
current thinking about how audiences make sense of media messages.


** Social Learning Theory

This theory hypothesised that people learn from one another through
observational learning, imitation and modeling , and outlines three
requirements for people to learn and model behaviour:

- Attention and retention of what has been observed
- The ability to reproduce the behaviour
- Motivation for adopting the behaviour

Social learning theory proposed that audience members learn violence
through modelling - reproducing what they have seen in the media.

** Agenda Setting Function

The agenda-setting theory holds that the function of the media is not
to tell audiences what to think, but what to think about and how to
think about it. This theory was developed at a time when media
resarchers began questioning the idea that the media had limited
effects on its audiences.

The theory has two levels:

- The media sets the news agenda by telling audiences which issues are important.
- The media then suggests to audiences how they might think aabout an
  issue and which aspects of it are more important than others.

Agenda setting occurs through a process called gatekeeping in which
the media controls the flow of information disseminated to audiences
and thus determines a dominant or preferred reading of any given
issue.

The media also engages in a process termed priming in which some
issues are given coverage and others are ignored or minimised.

The media is influenced by issues of ownership and control, knowledge
of its audiiences and their values, access to footage and sources of
information, and the social and political context in which it
operates.




** Cultivation Theory

Cultivation theorists aruge that TV has long term effects that are
small, gradual, indirect but cumulative and significant. The dominant
effect is termed mainstreaming.

=Use of reality tv shows=

*** Gerbner

the overt expression of physical force (with or without a weapon,
against self or others) compelling action against one's will on pairs
of being hurt and/ or killed or threatened to be so victimized as part
of the plot.

*** Mean world synrome

An extension of cultiavtation thoery is the idea that watching TV
alters audience perception of relity to believe that the world is worse
than it actually is. 

** Reinforcement Theory

This is where audeinces use the media to reinforce thier existing
beliefs and values. 



** Uses and Gratification Theory

These needs are understood to include:

- Surveillance :: we like to keep an eye on what is happening in the
                  world, to find out what is going, to learn, to
                  satisfy our curiosity, to find information and to
                  reassure ourselves about our personal security.
- Personal Idenity :: we use the media to find out who we are by
     comparing ourselves with others, by identifying with someone we
     value, by reinforcing our beliefs and by finding models of
     behaviour.
- Personal Relationships :: the media helps us to gain insight into
     the lives of others, to empathise, to give us something to talk
     about with our friends and families.
- Diversion :: the media can help us to relieve stress, to relax, to
               fill in time, to give emotional release, or just be for
               fun.

** Criticisms of the uses and gratifications theory

- People use media completely to gratify themselves
- People consuming media are always active (wouldn't work for 5 year old watching a horror)
- 


** Postmodernity & Postmodernism

Postmodern approaches to media reject the distinction between high
culture and popular culture. Postmodernism promotes parody, irony and
playfulness.

Postmodernism describes a broad movement that developed in the mid to
late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture and
criticism which marked a departure from modernism.

Postmodernity is the economic or cultural state or condition of
society which is said to exist after modernity.



** Reception Analysis

This area deals with the meanings the audience constructs from the
media. Reception theorists reject behaviourist cause-and-effect models
and empirical quantitative media research as too narrowly focused to
provide answers to the biger questions of the relationship between
audiences and the media they consume.

Reception studies employs aspects of semiotic analysis to determine
the 'politics of signification'.





** Media And Audience Framing

** Issues in Media Influence Today

In terms of media influence, issues such as intellectual property
rights, privacy and censorship and control must now be considered in a
different light. If audiences can now access everything do they?
Should they? And what can we do to protect vulnerable?

** Vulnerable Audiences

Some audiences are more susceptible to media influence than others. As
each new media technology arrives, the target audience for these
technologies is claimed to be at greatest risk. Over the years,
susceptibliity has been variously attributed to men, women, the
mentally unstable, heavy users, and of course children, who have been
claimed to be susceptible to anything and everything.

*** Case Studies

A process or record of research into the development of a particular
person, group or situation over a period of time.

*** Laboratory Research

Replicable research conducted in a laboratory setting. Ignores how
media consumption occurs in the real world.

*** Longitudinal Research

Occurs over a long period of time (years or even decades) where
research is gathered from the same subjects.

*** Correlation Studies

Any research that finds a correlation between two sets of
data. Researches look for relationships between variables.

*** Qualitative Research

This involves long questionaires and detailed responses about media use.

*** Quantitative Research

Includes results of surveys and statistics.

*** Meta-analysis
    
When researches look at a number of studies and draw conclusions from
the collective results of this research. When the treatment effect (or
effect size) is consistent from one study to the next, meta-analysis
can be used to idenfiy this common effect.

* Practice SAC Questions

1. Name the texts that you studied for media texts and societies values
   this year.
   - Archie & the Editorial (All in the family) - 70s
   - Ruger Ad. - 90s
   - Penn & Teller: Bullshit! - 2005
   - Secrets (The Walking Dead) - 2011/2012
   - Bushmaster Ad - 2012

2. Describe one dominant value in one text that you studied this
   year. (2 marks)
   - The dominant value of the Ruger Ad was for gun safety and was
     aimed at an audience of law abiding citizens which was a smaller
     market at the time. This was to introduce new consumers of guns
     matching the dominant value of society of the right to bear
     arms. This is represented through various forms:
     - The blue colour which implies law enforcement, order and authority
     - 'More Than World Class, World's Best' which targets buyers of
       the corporate and educated demographic.
     - White backlight to represent the gun in an angelic manner.
     - Row of aligned golden bullet also showing order.
     - 'new design, new technology, quality control and extensive
       testing' which appeals to the target audience.

3. Outline how another text you studied reflects an oppositoinal or
   emerging value. (2 marks)
   - The Bushmaster Ad of 2012 represents the oppositional value of
     society at the time. This is targeted at 'real manly men' and was
     aimed to distinguish gun owners from the criminal acts of school
     shooting at the time. This poster achieves this in the following
     ways:
     - Colours of red, black and grey. This choice of red is provoking
       and stands out.
     - The font used is all caps and is very bold and striking bringing
       a powerful look to the ad.
     - Various references to 'manliness' are evident to encourage the
       reader to feel challenged of their masculinity.
     - Contrast of Adam L as unmanly to distance the audience from the
       event of the school shooting and see that as an unmanly act.
   - The oppositional value in society during the twenty-teens was the
     right to bear arms. The Bushmaster ad represented this value
     through its appeal to manliness and response to Adam L, the
     perpertrator of a school shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary. The
     ad showcases the gun in a provoking manner through its bold all
     caps font and grungy background. The colours chosen, red, black
     and grey also emphasise this confronting look which appeals to
     'manly men'. The ad makes various references to masculinity and
     the 'man card' which is to be 'revoked' and 'reissued' on
     purchase of the gun. This supports the oppoistional value showing
     owners of this gun who believe in the right to bear arms who also
     want to be an alpha male. This is contrasted with Adam L who is
     considered 'unmanly' though he had used this gun. This distances
     the reader from him as he used the gun for the wrong
     purpose.
4. Analyse how a social issue or discourse evolves from societies
   values as reflected in the media texts you studied this year. (6
   marks)
   - /(First attempt)/ In my discourse, Gun Violence in America from
     the 1960s til today, societies values have evolved and can be
     seen through various advertisements and the production of various
     tv series'. During the 1960s a less serious approach to the
     consumerism of gun ownership is present through the bright
     colours and inclusion of children. This was during a time that
     guns were much more prevalent and were the dominant value was pro
     gun ownership. Moving into the 70s, the representation of guns
     had changed to a sport. As the dominant value was fading, more
     advertisements of gun safety emerged and today as the discourse
     is now equally sided, the media representation of guns is evident
     in both arguments.
   - In the earlier study of the discourse, the dominant value at the
     time was pro gun ownership. This is evident in the character
     Archie in 'Archie & the Editorial' and in the advertisements of
     gun. During this time guns were taken lightly for its effect on
     violence by the majority and were seen as a item of
     'manliness'. During this time of high crime rates and assinations,
     the emerging value of gun regulation became more
     prevalent. Evident in the Ruger Ad we can see the focus on gun
     safety and law and order emerge into the dominant value. Moving
     into 2005 this dominant value of gun control caused debate and
     this is seen in Penn & Teller: Bullshit were logical arguments of
     gun ownership was better represented to show the issues with
     regulation for safety against criminals.
   - In the discourse studied, society's values have evolved and can
     be seen through the various the values and representations in the
     texts studied. The dominant value of the 1960s was for gun
     ownership, this is seen in the advertisements of items and their
     inclusion of guns. During this time it can be seen that guns were
     lightly taken due to the use of children, bright colours
     - shift in the orginal dominant value to the dominant value today
     - discourse is an ongoing discussion as texts respond to real
       life incidences.
5. Analyse the relationship between a dominant value and either an
   oppsitional or emerging value. Explain representation of each and
   how it reflects the society of its production. (8 marks)
   - During 2005 the dominant value for the discourse was pro gun
     regulation, which was heavily debated. Penn & Teller: Bullshit
     however juxtaposed this value with the oppositional value of
     society at the time which was for gun ownership. This contrast is
     evident in the representation of the characters to bring the
     audience to agreeing with the 'right to bear arms'. This was done
     through Suzanna who is shown as relatable and is seen as an
     everyday American. This is done through showing shots of her in
     her home doing everyday chores and by the absence of playful music
     when compared to other characteres. This is contrasted by the
     character Roger R, who can be constantly shown as smug through his
     acting.

Only confirmed motive is the shooter's statements to 911 operators and
hostage negotiators.  He told them he pledged allegiance to ISIS and
wanted people to know the pain that Syrains and Iraqis felt.

    
** How the values are represented

* Past Exams

- Identify, compare and contrast past representations of discourse in media text.
- Use production and story elements to justify answers.

- Stagnant Discussion
- Talk about influences

* Glossary

- mainstreaming :: the 'blurring, blending and bending' attitudes
                   which confirm fears and prejudices about the 'way
                   things are'.
