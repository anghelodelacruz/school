<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Explain how the RBA uses open market operations to increase interest rates.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The RBA controls interest rates through the open market
operations. This is achieved through changing the liquidity in the
banks by the buying and selling of securities. To increase the
interest rates, the RBA will sell commonwealth government securities
and this will reduce the liquidity of the banks. This affects the
supply of the reserve causing the banks to raise their interest rates.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Evaulate the effectiveness of monetary policy in achieving domestic economic stabililty over the last three years.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
It can be said the that RBA has successfully employed monetary policy
over recent years as inflation is no longer an issue. Its expansionary
stance has helped to stimulate economic and employment growth. Since
2013, growth hasn't dropped below 2% and has reached target goal of
3.3% in 2015-2016. However during 2016 the rate of inflation fell to
1% with the possibility of deflation and reduced the cash rate lower
to 1.5%. This effectiveness in the future can be questioned as now
there is a relatively high level of household indebtedness. This can
also have negative impacts on those reliant on interest income.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Consider the following information</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Throughout 2011 [January to November], the Reserve Bank of
Australia held the cash rate steady at 4.75%
</li>
<li>In 2009-10 the budget outcome was a deficit of $52.9b. The deficit
in 2010-11 was predicted to be $40.8b with the government planning
to move the budgget to a surplus in 2012-13.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> Describe the policy stance adopted by the government in relation to budgetary policy for the period identified above.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
The policy stance in the year 2010-2011 was a more contractionary
stance as the deficit is predicted to be reduced from $52.9b to
$40.8b. This is also evident in their plans to move the budget to
surplus in the coming two years.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.2</span> Explain the difference in the stance adopted by the Reserve Bank in setting monetary policy.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
Holding a steady cash rate shows a neutral stance allowing the
business cycle and automatic stabilisers to play their role. However
an unchanged monetary policy held above the usual 3.5% can be seen as
an contractionary monetary policy as it is more accommdating. This is
similar with the governments more contractionary stance compared to
the previous year.

<h4 id="sec-1-3-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.3</span> Monetary and budgetary policies are often referred to as 'demand management policies'. Explain this means.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">
<p>
Monetary and budgetary policies can be refered to as demand management
policies due to its ability to affect the aggregate demand and
unemployment of a nation aswell as its interest rates which also
impact on AD. Monetary policy is also unable to affect certain
pressures supply side issues such as cost inflation.

The key components that they effect are C and I.

By changing disposable income or affecting borrowing and investing by changing interest rates.

<h4 id="sec-1-3-5"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.5</span> Explain how budgetary policy may be used to overcome a slowing economy and how this may negatively impact upon external stability.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-5">
<p>
During a slowing economy the budget outcome will be a
deficit. Expansionary budgetary policies can be financed in several
ways. One of these ways is through selling bonds to Australian
Investors. This will create the problem of crowding out not only in
the private sector but also in the external sector. This is caused by
the higher interest rates pushed onto local borrowers causing
exporters and import businesses to lose market share.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<blockquote>
<p>
'Looking ahead, the Bank expect unemployment to rise
further before it peaks. Over time, growth is expected to strengthen,
helped by continued low interest rates and the lower exchange
rate. Inflation is expected to be consistent with the 2-3 per cent
target over the next two years.'

<p>
A continued low interest rate could lead to high unstable economic
activity. This could cause a number of problems such as inflationary
presssures and low savings and investment. This effects our
