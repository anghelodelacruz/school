We'll all need to learn some basic Python programming in order to
survive this course. Here are some tips.

* Install Python

** Windows

- Grab the 32-bit installer if you have 32-bit Windows or you aren't sure if you do: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6.msi
- Grab the 64-bit installer if you have 64-bit Windows and you're sure of that: http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6.amd64.msi

** Mac OS X

- If you have OS X 10.6 or later, grab http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6-macosx10.6.dmg
- If you only have OS X 10.3 or later, grab instead http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6-macosx10.3.dmg

** Linux

- Use your package manager to install Python.

* Read a tutorial (or two)

1. Start with this: [[http://www.nerdparadise.com/tech/python/4minutecrashcourse/][4 Minute Python Crash Course]] --- it just gives some
  example code so you know what Python looks like

2. Next, read [[http://hetland.org/writing/instant-python.html][Instant Python]]. This is a longer read, but do read it
   carefully. Try some examples yourself. You can stop when you reach
   the section "A Jedi Mind Trick."

3. If you want more tutorials, visit the official [[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/][Learning Python]] page
   from the creators of the language.

If you get stuck on the installation (i.e., you can't get Python to
work on your machine), you can go to the website [[http://www.learnpython.org/][learnpython.org]] and
try some Python programming in your browser.
