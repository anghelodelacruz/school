* Monetary Policy
  
Relies on changing the level of interest rates to alter the cost,
demand and availability of credit. It has fast impact and does not
require the involvement of parliament.

** Role of RBA:

- banker to the government, banks, and NBFIs (Non-bank Financial
  Institute)
- Issues notes and coins
- custodian of overseas currency reserves

*Priority* is low inflation; as it is a precondition to achieving
 consumer and business confidence.

RBA board meets monthly on Tuesday (except January), and considers the
following economic data:

- Quarterly trends in headline CPI
- Spending levels (C), (I)
  - Building approvals
  - Household debt
- Unemployment rate
  - Job vaccancies
  - Participation
- Overseas markets
- Government budgetary stance.

Monetary Policy works in a counter cylical pattern.

** Definition

Monetary policy is operated by the RBA on behalf of the government and
involves the manipulation of key financial variables in the economy
(primarily interest rates) in order to achieve specific economic goals
and ultimately improve the living standards or welfare of all
Australians. The medium term objective is 'stability of the
currency', which the RBA currently defines as price stability, where
consumer price inflation is kept between 2 and 3 per cent, on average,
over time.

The RBA will only be concerned if inflation is outside the range for a
'sustained' period. Once low inflation is achieved, the RBA can then
focus on policy decisions that assist in the attainment.

** Objectives

- the stability of the currency of Australia
- the maintenance of full employment in Australia
- the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of the Australia.

Monetary policy will generally be useed in a counter-cyclical way to
boost activity when inflation and growth are low and restrain activity
when inflation and growth are high.

*** Underlying rate of Inflation



*** Financial Stability



** Implementation

** Cash rate and Open Market Operations

The RBA manipulates the cash rate by buying and selling *Commonwealth
Government Securities (CGS)* or repurchase agreements (repos) to
participants in the cash market (primarily banks). This manipulation
of the cash market is commonly referred to as *open market operations
(OMOs)* or domestic market operations.

** Strengths and weeknesses of Monetary Policy

*** Strengths

- Free from political bias
- Short Implementation lag
- Powerful influence on consumers, investors, borrowers or lenders
- Good at restraining AD as policy reduces discretionary income of
  indebted households.

*** Weaknesses

- Is one dimensional and unable to concentrate its affect on a speicific area
- Full impact can take up to two years (Impact lag)
- RBA does not have direct control over interest rates. This could
  mean financial insitutions won't pass on 'in full' the reductions in
  the cash rate.
- A reduction in interest rates may not immediately increase AD
  because consumers are not forced to spend any increase in
  discretionary income.
- Policy becomes less effectve as levels of private sector
  indebtedness increase to high levels.
- Policy cannot directly reduce inflationary pressures that are
  generated from the supply side of the economy (cost inflation). This
  will instead only ignite demand inflationary pressures, worsening
  inflation overall.
