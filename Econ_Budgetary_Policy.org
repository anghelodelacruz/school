* Nature and Operation of Budgetary Policy

** Definition

Budgetary policy (Also known as Fiscal Policy) refers to the
manipulation of the level and composition of Federal Government
receipts and outlays in order to assist in the achievement of its
economic and social goals for Australia. It is released annually each
May and contains estimates or projections of all income and
expenditure of the Government into the future. Though introduced in
May, new measures or 'mini budgets' can be taken by the Government.

** Objectives

The goal of all policies is to improve the welfare or living standards
of all Australians and to achieve the most efficient allocation of the
nation's resources.

This is achieved by:

- Strong and sustainable economic growth
- Low inflation
- Full Employment

This is clearly articulated in Government lesgilation (Charter of
Budget Honesty Act 1998)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Government's fiscal policy is to be directed at maintaining the
on-going economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia
and is therefore to be set in a sustainable medium-term framework.

** Composition of Revenue and Expenses

The Federal Government collects approximately $411 billion per annum
in receipts from various sources.

** Budget Outcomes

The Budget can have three possible outcomes:

\begin{align*}
	\text{Budget Balance} &= \text{Income(receipts)} = \text{Expenditure(outlays)}\\
    \text{Budget Deficit} &= \text{Income} < \text{Expenditure}\\
    \text{Budget Surplus} &= \text{Income} > \text{Expenditure}
\end{align*}

There are also several ways the Commonwealth Government will report
these outcomes.

*** Headline Cash Outcome

This is the total cash received by the Federal Government subtracted
by the total cash paid. This can be misleading as it includes cash
flows that do not directly impact on the economy.

*** Underlying Cash Outcome

This is the total cash received by the Federal Government subtracted
by the total cash paid. This can be misleading as it includes cash
flows that do not directly impact on the economy.

- Future Fund Earnings :: - interest and dividends earned by
     government owned 'Future fund'. Excluded as earnings are mandated
     to be reinvested.
- IFAAP :: - Investments in financial assets for policy purposes;
           including sale of government business enterprise (GBE),
           purchases of shares by the government or granting or
           repaying State Government debt. Excluded as does not
           directly add to economic activity

To illustrate (using hypothetical figures):

** Automatic and Discretionary Stabilisers
   
Stabilisers - help to dampen the severity of booms and recessions in the business cycles.

2 types: 

- Discretionary :: fiscal / budgetary policy determined by the
                   government as per the annual budget
- Automatic :: changes to the budget that occur automatically following changs in the level of economic activity

*** Autmoatic

  - Boom :: rising AD \rightarrow higher employment, incomes and
                 profits
    - Government tax revenues increases and welfare spending decreases
    - Fiscal system is automatically becoming contractionary
  - Recession :: falling AD \rightarrow higher unemployment,
                      lower incomes and profits.
    - Government tax revenues decreases and welfare payments increases
    - Fiscal situation is automatically becoming expansionary

Discretionary stabilisers are used when the automatic stabiliser are
not enough to correct a server boom or recession.




** Fiscal Drag / Bracket Creep

This occurs during times of inflation for countries with a progressive
tax system. When inflation occurs there is a decrease in the real wage
and workers will demand an increase in nominal wage to keep up with
inflatiion.

When the nominal wage increases, some workers are pushed into a higher
marginal tax bracket which increases the 'average' rate of tax paid.

These have two effects:

- Increases the total personal income tax revenue received by the
  Federeal Government.
- Some taxpayers will experience a decline in their real disposable
  income because they will be paying a higher average rate of tax.


** TODO Actual and Estimated Budget Outcomes

The Department of Treasury releases the 'actual' budget figures for
the previous financial year in September or October (16 months after
the release of the budget).

- Estimated budget outcome :: released in May
- Actual budget outcome :: released in September or October

The estimated budget outcome heavily relies on forecasts for economic
growth and other statistic which are never 100% accurate.

| Year 2                |       |
| Receipts              | $100B |
| Outlays               | $120B |
| Headline cash deficit | $20B  |






** TODO Expansionary v. Contractionary Budgets



** TODO Financing a Deficit / Investing a Surplus

*** Budget Deficit $R < E$

Expansionary $\rightarrow$ Rise in AD which impacts on production,
employment and inflation

The gap is financed by government borrowing:

1. Borrow from public and financial sector by sale of bonds
2. Borrow from the RBA
3. Overseas borrowings

*** Budget Surplus $R > E$

Contractionary $\rightarrow$ Fall in AD

Use of surplus:

1. Save with RBA
2. Place in special investment or savings fund
3. Repay local and foreign debt
   
*** Problems with a expansionary budget deficit



*** Dealing witha budget surplus

While a deficit tends to contribute to crowding out, a surplus tends
to do the opposite and contributes to crowding in of the private
sector.

*** Fiscal consolidation and the rationale for delivering a budget surplus

- Help buffer Austraia against future economic decline as surplus
  funds can be saved and then spent.
- Helps to generate greater international investor confidence in
  Australian government finances preserving Australia's AAA credit
  rating.
- Allows the cyclical component of the budget to do its job of
  automatically reducing the deficit as the economy recovers.
- Allows monetary policy to better manage the economy.

** TODO Budget and Economic Goals

In terms of Australia's specific domestic macroeconomic goals,
budgetary policy has a key role to play in the achieving of stability
in the level of domestic economic activity (also referred to as
*Internal Stability*)

*** Stablising the business cycle

*** Changing role of Budgetary Policy

*** Budgetary policy and low inflation

*** Budgetary policy and strong and sustainable growth

*** Budgetary policy and ull employment

** TODO Budgetary Policy and Living Standards

** Strengths and weaknesses of Budgetary Policy
*** Strengths
- Target particular sectors
- Greater range of economic goals
- Impact lag
- Effictively stimulating AD
- Effect through automatic stabilisers
- Checks and balances
*** Weakness
- Political hurdles
- Political bias
- Imlementation lag
- Inflexible
- Less effective at restricting AD during a boom
